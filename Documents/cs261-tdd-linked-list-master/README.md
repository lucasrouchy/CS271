# You Don't Know Linked Lists

But after this, you will.

In this assignment, you will engage in a test-driven development process to implement a circular, doubly-linked list, with an extra insert method
that maintains inserted values in a linked order. We'll call it a "LinkedList".

## Run the Test Suite

`python3 -m unittest test_linked_list`

Open both *test_linked_list.py* and *linked_list.py* in your editor of choice. Modify the implementation in *linked_list.py* to pass the first test. Once it passes, create a commit. Then, uncomment the next test, and re-run the test suite. Implement what's necessary to pass the test, and then repeat this process.

**But wait!**

Toward the middle of the test suite, you should be thinking about the algorithmic efficiency of each operation. What should be O(1)? What should be linear? In addition, try to implement your operations using recursion, whenever possible.

## Best Done in Pairs!

Get together with a friend in front of just one machine, and take turns being the driver. Change drivers after each test is passed. Don't forget to commit after each test.
